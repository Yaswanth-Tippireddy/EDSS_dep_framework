__ShinyProxy__ requires the images of user's shiny apps having been installed correctly, and the configuration is correctly registered in the `application.yml` file;

__Nginx__ should be started first to provide proxy service;


### Todo list:

- [ ]: check `docker-compose.yml` that can provoke `shinyproxy` successfully;
- [ ]: from `r-base` package build a new image with `shiny` and `shinydashboard` pre-installed;
